# üè° HomeIntel

## üìå Overview
**HomeIntel** is a full-stack web application designed to intelligently evaluate real estate listings by analyzing their features and estimating a fair market price. The system leverages **AI models**, **React** for the frontend, and **Spring Boot** for the backend to deliver real-time property assessments. Users can provide a URL (from Aruodas or Zillow) or input property data manually, prioritize different aspects of a property, and receive a detailed evaluation score.

## üöß React Development Rules

To maintain code consistency and scalability, follow these frontend coding conventions:

- Use **arrow functions**:  
  `const myFunction = () => {};`

- **Use CSS Modules only**:  
  - File naming: `ComponentName.module.css`  
  - Usage:  
    ```js
    import styles from './ComponentName.module.css';
    <div className={styles.exampleClass}></div>
    ```  
  - More info: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/

- Each **component must be in its own file**  
- Group related components in their **own folders**

## üõ†Ô∏è Git Workflow Rules

- Create a **new branch** for each feature/task.
- Branch naming format:  
  `[Initials]-[feature-name]`  
  Example: `JU-create-header` (JU = Jonas Urnƒó≈æius)
- Do development on that branch.
- Push branch to GitHub.
- Open a **Pull Request** and assign a reviewer.
- Each small task has its own branch!

| Action / Test Step                                    | Expected Outcome                        | Actual Outcome (Screenshot)            |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| User enters prompt and presses evaluate               | The program evaluates the prompt and shows results | ![Evaluate](images/evaluate.png) |
| User enters new data and presses reevaluate           | The program evaluates the new data and shows updated results | ![Reevaluate](images/reevaluate.png) |
| User presses home button after evaluation             | The program navigates to the home screen | ![Home Button](images/home_button.png) |
| User presses the logo                                  | The program redirects to the home screen | ![Logo](images/logo.png) |
| User presses one of the navbar options                | The program navigates to the selected page | ![Navbar Option](images/navbar_option.png) |
| User enters an invalid prompt                         | The program displays an error message | ![Invalid Prompt](images/invalid_prompt.png) |

## ‚ú® Features

- üîó **URL-Based Input**  
  Fetches real estate data automatically from Aruodas or Zillow URLs.

- üß† **AI-Powered Evaluation**  
  Evaluates property value and quality using machine learning techniques with `com.google.gson.*` for JSON parsing.

- üéØ **Priority Selection**  
  Users can prioritize different aspects of a property using a color-coded system (Red = not important, Green = very important).

- üìù **Editable Property Fields**  
  All property data is editable, enabling tailored evaluations based on user knowledge.

- üìä **Visual Evaluation Indicator**  
  Displays a circular indicator to show the overall property score using color gradients from green to red.

- üîÅ **Real-Time Recalculation**  
  Instantly updates results when any field is changed or additional information is provided.

## üß∞ Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- Java 17+
- Node.js & npm (v16+ recommended)
- Maven
- Internet connection
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

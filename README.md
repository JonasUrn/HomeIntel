## üìå Project Overview

Our objective is to develop a web application that analyzes real estate listings and returns a fair market price and evaluation score using AI-driven techniques. The system supports links from platforms such as **Aruodas** and **Zillow**, and generates intelligent, data-backed property assessments.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîó **URL-Based Input**  
  Fetches real estate data automatically from Aruodas or Zillow URLs.

- üß† **AI-Powered Evaluation**  
  Evaluates property value and quality using machine learning techniques with `com.google.gson.*` for JSON parsing.

- üéØ **Priority Selection**  
  Users can prioritize different aspects of a property using a color-coded system (Red = not important, Green = very important).

- üìù **Editable Property Fields**  
  All property data is editable, enabling tailored evaluations based on user knowledge.

- üìä **Visual Evaluation Indicator**  
  Displays a circular indicator to show the overall property score using color gradients from green to red.

- üîÅ **Real-Time Reevaluation**  
  Updates results when any field is changed or additional information is provided.

## üöÄ How to Use the Website

1. On the homepage, paste a valid real estate listing URL from Aruodas or Zillow, **or** switch to the prompt section to manually enter property details.
2. Click the **green arrow button** to proceed.
3. Select your evaluation priorities across various categories (color-coded as follows):  
   - üü• **Red** ‚Äì Not important  
   - üü® **Yellow** ‚Äì Neutral  
   - üü© **Green** ‚Äì Important  
4. Click the button again to submit your choices.
5. The result page will display:
   - **Top Left:** AI-generated evaluation score  
   - **Top Right:** Estimated fair price  
   - A colored indicator ring showing the overall evaluation (green = good, red = poor)
6. In the center section, you'll find detailed property information. These fields are editable.
7. If you make any changes or provide additional information, simply click the button again to **recalculate the score** based on updated data.

## üß∞ Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- Java 17+
- Node.js & npm (v16+ recommended)
- Maven
- Internet connection
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JonasUrn/HomeIntel.git
cd HomeIntel
```

### 2. Intstall frontend part
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Create or Switch to a Branch
```sh
git checkout -b [branch_name]
```

### 4. Create .env file
In ./HomenIntel path create .env file
Insert one line:
```sh
API_HOME_INTEL=[GEMINI_API_KEY]
```
Where GEMINI_API_KEY is your API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

Save it

### 5. Add and Commit Changes
```sh
git add --all
git commit -m "[Your commit message]"
```

### 6. Push Changes
```sh
git push -u origin [branch_name]
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

### 1. Start the Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Start the Backend
Open your IDE and run the following class:
```
src/main/java/com/homeintel/MainApplication.java
```

This will launch the Spring Boot backend server.

## üöß React Development Rules

To maintain code consistency and scalability, follow these frontend coding conventions:

- Use **arrow functions**:  
  `const myFunction = () => {};`

- **Use CSS Modules only**:  
  - File naming: `ComponentName.module.css`  
  - Usage:  
    ```js
    import styles from './ComponentName.module.css';
    <div className={styles.exampleClass}></div>
    ```  
  - More info: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/

- Each **component must be in its own file**  
- Group related components in their **own folders**

## üõ†Ô∏è Git Workflow Rules

- Create a **new branch** for each feature/task.
- Branch naming format:  
  `[Initials]-[feature-name]`  
  Example: `JU-create-header` (JU = Jonas Urnƒó≈æius)
- Do development on that branch.
- Push branch to GitHub.
- Open a **Pull Request** and assign a reviewer.
- Each small task has its own branch!

## ü§ù Contribution

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a feature branch  
3. Commit your changes  
4. Push to your fork  
5. Submit a pull request and assign a reviewer
